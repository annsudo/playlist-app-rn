# Collaborative Playlist Application üéµ 
üì¶ üöÄ  React-Native application creates collaborative playlist by integrates songs from youtube.

## Features

-   ‚ú® Share your playlist with people 
-   üêù Let others contribute to your playlist
-   üåÄ  Two modes availible: Contributer / Owner 

## Short description  
The application will be a playlist application where you will be able to share a playlist that you have made with people and they will be able to contribute to that playlist. The application currently only intgrates youtube into the platform platform. The playlist will have modes one is Contributer and One is Owner. When you are an owner you are in Owner mode and you are able to add and delete songs to your own playlist. When you do not own the playlist you are in Contributer mode where you are allowed to add songs to a playlist.

<!-- In the Owner mode, people can share a playlist and add songs to a playlist but only the owner will have complete control over which songs will be accepted to the playlist and which will not be accepted. This will be perfect in for example Event-based scenarios where there might be multiple people who might request songs constantly, for example, a house party. In the Contributer mode, all people are able to add and manipulate the playlist and also play the playlist on their own -->

## Install

```
npm install
npm start
npx react-native run-android
```

## Architecture/code
The main idea is that we leverage Model-View-Presenter strucutre with an added components folder. Views represent entire Screens while Components represent a small Component in that screen. Therefore you will only see 5 Views which represent each Screen and around 10+ components which represent smaller components within those screens. Since we are using Redux this is essentially our model. We do have a model folder but it is only used for Typescript definition that we might use. Presenters are where we connect Redux with our components and views, they also contain our some API calls.

In the view folder you can see the Views for our application.

In the presenters folder you can see the Presenters for our application.

In the components you can see smaller components which are used to build up a view.

In the model folder you can see some Typescript typing used to define some objects that we use. 

In the store we describet redux store which is essentially our "model" in the MVP and how we leverage redux in our application.

We also have a util folder that describes our API call. 

In the android folder is the actual android project which is built and used for testing

In the IOS folder is the actual IOS project which is built and used for testing

## Usage
### DISCLAIMER: THIS APP ONLY WORKS ON ANDROID (since some of the dev team do not have macBooks and cant run virtual machine of iOS)
#### If you have a previous version uninstall it first 
You install the app by going to our dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ld1sktshh0fs9eh/app-release.apk?dl=0

Currently there only exists an android version for the application. You will need to change you android settings to allow unknown sources to install third party apps. You will then install the APK in the dropbox link. You can follow this tutorial for how to install it on Android https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9aikSC5rw8.



1. Download the APK from the dropbox link provided above.
2. You need a way to traverse the file system on Android. I recommend the App My Files which most likely some of you have. I use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.myfiles&hl=en&gl=US
3. Find where the APK is stored.
4. Click on the APK. A window will pop up telling you that you are not allowed to install apps form unknown sources.
5. Click on Setting in this Window.
6. A new window will pop up. Enable allow from this sources in the settings.
7. Use My Files to traverse to the apk again.
8. Click on it and press install
9. Then click open and it should work.
